To clone a repository from GitHub, you can use the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/sankalp1999/rails_tiny_url.git`
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install any dependencies by running:

`bundle install`
Then, you can start the Rails server by running:

`rails server`

This will start the application on your local machine and you can access it by going to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
